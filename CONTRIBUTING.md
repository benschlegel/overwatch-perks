# Contributing

This project is currently still under development by me and I don't plan to integrate feature pull requests until I'm at a baseline of the project I'm happy with.

If you find any bugs and want to provide a fix, I'm more than happy to take a look at your pull request and integrate it, otherwise you can open a new issue!

This document will be updated with more infos on contributing once I'm ready to accept feature pull requests.
